# COVID-19 Outbreak Tracker

Woohoo!! 🎉🎉 Finally its shipped in the real-world. 📦

Well, Upon learning & practicing **ReactJS & Gatsby** I have came up with an idea to build a real-world application & my minds popped out with this awesome idea! ⚡ Been building this since last 6-7 days. ⏱ Aaaand finally its here. **MY FIRST EVER OPENSOURCE CONTRIBUTION!** Self learning really paid off! 💯

I've learnt so many things in the way of making this application 📝 and ways to do the same work in different ways. Specially from [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8QAzbLcRglXeN_MY9blyw) 🥇 is truly an inspiration to me. Apart from that I wanna thank to these mentors as well for being there to teach people in a effective way 💯
